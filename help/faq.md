This FAQ page answers some of the more commonly asked questions from the PancakeSwap community.

## Is HopiumSwap safe? Has HopiumSwap been Audited?

See for yourself:

* Transparent:
  * We’re built on open-source software: our site and all our Smart Contracts are publicly visible for maximum transparency.
  * Our contracts will be verified on PolygonScan so you know that what you see is what you get.
* Security best practices:
  * The chefs use multisig for all contracts.
  * Our contracts’ time-lock gives you peace of mind.

## What is the difference between staking and farming?

We will have staking and farming in the near future!

Staking only needs some HOPE to be added to a Hopium Pool to earn HOPE or other tokens.\


Farming is more complicated and needs LP Tokens to earn HOPE.\


## Where can I view the HopiumSwap roadmap?

You can [view our to-do list here, but don't call it a roadmap](https://docs.hopiumswap.info/product-docs/roadmap).

## How do I connect my wallet to Polygon Network and HopiumSwap?

We have a [Connect Your Wallet to PancakeSwap guide](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/get-started/connection-guide) covering this in detail.

## What's the best wallet for HopiumSwap?

It depends on your needs. We have an [in-depth guide to selecting and creating a wallet](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/get-started/wallet-guide) that's right for you.

## When will you open more pools?

New Pools are added to HopiumSwap frequently. There will always be an announcement before the launch of new pools.

Join the [announcements Telegram group](https://t.me/PancakeSwapAnn) to learn about new Pools as early as possible.



## How do I get airdrops?

Whenever there is an official airdrop on HopiumSwap it will be announced along with the requirements.

Please remember anyone can airdrop tokens to HopiumSwap users since every transaction is public on Polygonscan. Be sure to do your own research when it comes to non-official airdrops. To protect your funds, we recommend you don't use a smart contract you don't understand from a source you don't trust.

Learn about our bug bounty and potential bounty payouts.

## Where can I view smart contracts?

Learn how to find smart contracts on our [Finding Contracts page](https://github.com/TheCryptoMonster).

## Why does it say I have no Matic balance?

If you've already transferred BNB into your Polygon Network-enabled wallet but still have this error, you're most likely not connected to Polygon Network within your wallet. Check your wallet's selected network and make sure you have Polygon Network selected.

## What is the max supply of HOPE?

$HOPE does not have a maximum supply. The circulating supply is managed through built-in burning and regular burning events.

## What are the treasury funds used for?

The treasury funds are used to cover the expenses involved in running HopiumSwap. These expenses include salaries, audits, prizes, hosting, upkeep, bounties, etc.

## Where can I check the Analytics?

You can check the analytics of HopiumSwap by click on the "Analytics" tab on the top menu.

## Is HopiumSwap protected from flashloan attacks?

HopiumSwap's vault has anti-flashloan protection. HopiumSwap’s CAKE token isn’t vulnerable to flash loan attacks. Unlike vulnerable tokens, HOPE token minting is predefined, and can’t be adjusted in a single transaction. Ownership cannot be transferred outside of MasterChef contract.

HopiumSwap’s other smart contracts, like IFO and AutoPool, are protected as well; they prevent other contracts from interacting with them, reducing the scope of vector attacks.

## Can I join the HopiumSwap team?

Check the Become a team area for information on open positions we're looking to fill.

We advertise new positions we're looking to fill on our official social media channels, so be sure to follow us to get the latest hiring information.

## What is SYRUP?

SYRUP was a part of the staking process earlier in HopiumSwap's life. SYRUP was discontinued when a security issue was discovered and is no longer a part of HopiumSwap.
