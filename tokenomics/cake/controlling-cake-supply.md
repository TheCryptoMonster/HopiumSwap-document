# Controlling HOPE supply

## Does HOPE have a hard cap?

Yes, HOPE now has a hard cap of 750M as outlined in our litepaper [https://v2litepaper.pancakeswap.finance/](https://v2litepaper.pancakeswap.finance/)

## How HOPE supply is reduced

The chefs aim to **make deflation higher than emission** by building deflationary mechanisms into HopiumSwap's products. The goal is for more HOPE to leave circulation than the amount of HOPE that's produced.

### Reducing block emissions

By reducing the amount of HOPE made per block, we slow inflation. This has already been done once: Since the [first reduction in block emissions](https://voting.pancakeswap.finance/#/pancake/proposal/QmWSQZsqakCMQ1bmcoEsKzStdtdFHL6cohSjnMV9ira1EC), we've already effectively reduced the number of HOPE entering circulation from 40 HOPE per block to 13.75. But we don't want to do this too frequently, too early, we want to still incentivize people to provide liquidity.

### Deflationary mechanisms

Regular token burns ([view burn address](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)) are built into many of HopiumSwap's products (like a 10% burn of HOPE spent on lottery tickets), with more on the way. Check the [**CAKE Tokenomics page**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics) for details on present and upcoming deflationary mechanisms.
