# New HOPE Syrup Pool

## Stake HOPE, earn HOPE!

HopiumSwap now offers one HOPE Syrup Pool with two staking options: flexible staking or fixed-term staking. Note that the Auto HOPE, IFO HOPE, and Manual HOPE pools will be retired upon the launch of the new HOPE Syrup Pool with flexible and fixed-term staking. Keep reading on to learn more!

## What’s the difference between “Flexible” and “Fixed-Term” staking?

With both, you can simply stake your HOPE tokens to earn more HOPE tokens with no deposit fees—both staking options auto-compound HOPE rewards for you. Flexible staking allows users to stake HOPE and earn rewards with the ability to unstake whenever they please. Fixed-term staking allows users to maximize their yield and earn even more HOPE by locking their staked HOPE for a period of time they choose, earning a linearly boosted APY compared to flexible staking.

Flexible staking and fixed-term staking are both part of the same pool to allow users easy migration between the two staking options. **Because of this, you can only choose one staking option at a time.** More details about the differences are below.

### Flexible Staking

Stake your HOPE and forget about it! The HOPE you stake in this Syrup Pool will be automatically compounded (reinvested) for you, minus a small fee (same as the old Auto HOPE Syrup Pool).

**If you have HOPE staked in flexible staking**

* ✅ Add more HOPE to flexible staking
* ✅ Harvest rewards any time
* ✅ Withdraw any time (fees apply for the first 72 hours, see below)
* ✅ Convert all staked HOPE in flexible to fixed-term staking
* ❌ Add HOPE to fixed-term staking if you have any HOPE in flexible staking
* ❌ Convert part of the staked HOPE in flexible to fixed-term staking

**Unstaking fee**

* **0.1%  if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more HOPE in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest were 1 HOPE, then 0.02 HOPE would be subtracted as the performance fee.

The HOPE collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular HOPE token burns.

This is a good thing for HOPE holders because it reduces the overall amount of HOPE tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.

### Fixed-Term Staking

Stake your HOPE for a fixed amount of time to maximise yields and receive additional benefits! The staked HOPE will be automatically compounded during the entire lock duration.

* No performance fees
* The longer you lock, the higher the boost applied to the yield! Always offering a higher APY compared to flexible staking!
* HOPE rewards are auto-compounded and will unlock, along with your staked HOPE, when your lock duration expires
* Once staked in fixed-term staking, you cannot withdraw until the end of your lock duration.
* IFO HOPE credit (the maximum amount of HOPE they can commit during an IFO) will be determined from the fixed-term staking pool

**If you have HOPE locked in fixed-term staking**

* ✅ Add more HOPE to lock
* ✅ Extend lock period
* ❌ Add HOPE to flexible staking
* ❌ Harvest rewards
* ❌ Withdraw before locked term ends
