# vHOPE

### What is vHope?

vHOPE is a number representing the boosted voting power based on a userâ€™s fixed-term CAKE staking position.

The vHOPE number will be added to your total voting power.

**Similar to i**HOPE**, vHOPE is NOT a new token.**

vHOPE IS NOT transferrable or tradeable.

### How is vHOPE calculated?

vHOPE is calculated based on two variables:

1. The amount of HOPE located in the Fixed-Term Staking Pool
2. The remaining lock durations of the staking positions

For point 2., it is important to clarify that the remaining lock duration is not (a) how many weeks you committed your HOPE for when you first locked it up (e.g. 52 weeks), but (b) the time remaining on your lock. In this case, if you locked HOPE for 52 weeks around 10 weeks ago, your remaining lock duration is 42 weeks, not 52 weeks.

If your remaining staking duration is less than one week, your vHOPE is equal to the amount of HOPE locked in the HOPE pool.

If your remaining staking duration is more than one week, your vHOPE is equal to the amount of HOPE locked, multiplied by the number of weeks left in the staking position.

For example:

* Alice locked 100 HOPE for 52 weeks; her staking position will unlock in 40 weeks. She has \`100 x 40 = 4000 vHOPE\`
* Bob locked 100 HOPE for 52 weeks; his staking position will unlock in 52 weeks. He has \`100 x 52 = 5200 vHOPE\`
* Carole locked 100 HOPE for ten weeks; and her staking position has ended. She has \`100 vHOPE\`
